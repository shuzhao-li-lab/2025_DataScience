# :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Repo Overview

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and raw metabolomics datasets used in the book chapter on using Jupyter for data science in metabolomics. It is designed to support reproducible learning through hands-on exploration, visualization, and analysis of metabolomics data. 

The included notebooks are intended to be run on **Google Colab** for easy access and setup:

- ***Notebook 1 (Python)***: Understanding core LC-MS concepts and exploring raw metabolomics data using common metabolomics/data science tools such as pandas, seaborn, pymzML, and asari (e.g. plotting spectrum, chromatograms, heatmaps of sample similarity)

- ***Notebook 2 (R)***: Analyzing processed metabolomics data using stats, ggplot2, and tidyr (e.g. batch correction, PCAs, and univariate analysis)

Jupyter supports multiple programming languages; the book chapter focuses on Python and R, the two most widely used in metabolomics data science.

## :rocket: Getting Started

### 1. Open Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab

Click on the links below to directly launch the notebooks in Google Colab:

* [Python - Core LC-MS concepts and QC samples](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zbMrJkDgW8gNhaguS9uzsJKpS3HJHeMs?usp=drive_link)

* [R - Data analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19Uqy-EvZEP5OsQ13_UYC4xqfFmzxkH_Y?usp=drive_link)

### 2. Download Jupyter notebooks and upload to Google Colab

Download the notebooks from the /notebook folder of this GitHub repository. Go to the [Google Colab homepage](https://colab.research.google.com/) and 
a pop-up should appear that says "Open notebook". In the left-side options, select upload. Drag-and-drop the downloaded notebook and voila! You are ready to explore the notebook in Colab.
