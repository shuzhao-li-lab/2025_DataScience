# :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Repo Overview

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and raw metabolomics datasets used in the book chapter on using Jupyter for data science in metabolomics. It is designed to support reproducible learning through hands-on exploration, visualization, and analysis of metabolomics data. 

The included notebooks are intended to be run on **Google Colab** for easy access and setup:

- ***Notebook 1 (Python)***: Exploring raw metabolomics data using common data science tools such as pandas, seaborn, and pymzML (e.g. plotting chromatograms, heatmaps of sample similarity)

- ***Notebook 2 (R)***: Analyzing processed metabolomics data using stats, ggplot2, and tidyr (e.g. batch correction, PCAs, univariate analysis, pathway analysis)

Jupyter supports multiple programming languages; the book chapter focuses on Python and R, the two most widely used in metabolomics data science.
